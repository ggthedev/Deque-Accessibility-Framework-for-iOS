**Getting started**

To install this framework into your own project, download DQA11y.framework from [here](https://github.com/dequelabs/Deque-Accessibility-Framework-for-iOS/tree/master/Products).  You can find the framework in the “Products” folder. After downloading, simply drag and drop this file into your Xcode project!

Doxygen was used to create documentation for this project.  If you do not have Doxygen, you can find it [here](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen).  To generate the documentation, download this repository, then open up the folder in Doxygen.  Everything should already be configured for you in Doxygen.  All you need to do is click “Next.”  If something is not configured correctly, look below for more details.  Once you get to the “Run” tab, click the “Run doxygen” button on the left side, and once it has finished, click “Show HTML output.”

  Make sure everything is filled in, then click “Next.” Under “Select the desired extraction mode:” “Documented entities only” should be set, and under “Select programming language to optimize the results for” “Optimize for C++ output” should be selected.  Hit next. Choose the format that you would prefer, then hit “Next.”
